# Hey friend ! I'm Earnest Blade ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm a French hobbyist developer and I love **exploring and learning new stuff** ! I'm interested into gamedev and into game engines because. I also love **creating stories or writing adventure**s : that's why I love games.

Currently, I'm working on [Emission](https://github.com/Earnest-Blade/Emission-Engine), my own Game Engine because It's a great way to learn how to do it. It's a very slow and complex project, but I love working on it ! I'm also creating a game engine because I'm planning to create my own games *(I already created some on Unity, but it's way cooler with my own engine)*.
You can also check [my shitty repos](https://github.com/Earnest-Blade?tab=repositories).
